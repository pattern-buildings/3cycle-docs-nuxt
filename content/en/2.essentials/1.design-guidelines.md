# Design Guidelines

Effective use of the 3Cycle system requires understanding its core design principles and how to apply them to your projects.

## Design Thinking with 3Cycle

### Start with Requirements

Before selecting components, clearly define your project requirements:

- **Building type** - Residential, commercial, industrial, or mixed-use
- **Dimensions** - Overall size and spatial requirements
- **Climate zone** - Local weather conditions and thermal requirements
- **Budget constraints** - Cost targets and timeline considerations
- **Site conditions** - Ground characteristics and accessibility

### Select Components Systematically

Use the component categories to systematically build your design:

1. **Define structural grid** - Determine spacing and module sizes based on requirements
2. **Design structural layout** - Arrange modules and connections to carry loads
3. **Plan enclosure** - Select skin systems and insulation appropriate for climate
4. **Integrate services** - Route utilities through service channels
5. **Plan openings** - Position windows and doors for daylight and ventilation

### Optimize Configuration

With standardized components, optimization becomes straightforward:

- **Reduce variant count** - Use standard component sizes to minimize manufacturing complexity
- **Maximize repetition** - Design components to appear multiple times in a project
- **Plan assembly sequence** - Organize installation order to minimize site work
- **Account for access** - Ensure adequate space for worker movement during assembly

## Dimensional Coordination

The 3Cycle system uses a dimensional coordination grid to ensure all components fit together perfectly.

### Module Sizes

Standard module dimensions are based on a coordination grid:

- **Primary grid** - 1.2m, 1.8m, 2.4m, 3.0m, 3.6m intervals
- **Component spacing** - Consistent offset for connections and tolerances
- **Openings** - Window and door sizes follow the coordination grid

### Connection Points

All connection points align to the coordination grid, enabling:

- **Perfect fit** - Components assemble without modification
- **Interchangeability** - Any component designed for a location works in that location
- **Predictable assembly** - No custom cutting or adjustments needed on site

## Material Selection

### Timber Specifications

The 3Cycle system specifies timber grades and treatments for different applications:

- **Structural timber** - High-grade timber for load-bearing components
- **Treated timber** - Protected against moisture and insect damage
- **Cladding materials** - Weather-resistant options for external surfaces

### Sustainability Considerations

Select materials based on:

- **Source origin** - Prefer sustainably harvested timber from certified forests
- **Transportation distance** - Minimize environmental impact through local sourcing when possible
- **Durability** - Long-lasting materials reduce replacement needs and waste
- **End-of-life** - Select materials that can be recycled or safely decomposed

## Assembly Considerations

### Design for Manufacturing

Components should be designed to be manufactured efficiently:

- **Minimize complexity** - Avoid unnecessary details that complicate manufacturing
- **Standard tools** - Use manufacturing equipment and tools readily available
- **Quality control points** - Build in inspection steps to catch defects early

### Design for Assembly

On-site assembly should be straightforward and safe:

- **Logical sequence** - Plan assembly order that makes physical sense
- **Adequate access** - Ensure workers can reach all connection points
- **Clear instructions** - Provide step-by-step assembly guidance
- **Safety provisions** - Account for worker safety during assembly

## Customization Within Standards

The 3Cycle system allows design customization while maintaining standardization:

### Allowed Variations

- **Cladding materials** - Different external finishes for aesthetic preference
- **Interior finishes** - Choice of interior wall and flooring treatments
- **Window types** - Different glazing and frame colors within standard sizes
- **Service routing** - Flexibility in utility channel routing within components

### Required Standards

These elements must remain standardized:

- **Component dimensions** - Must match the coordination grid exactly
- **Connection methods** - Must use specified joining systems
- **Structural capacity** - Cannot be reduced from specifications
- **Thermal performance** - Cannot be reduced from minimum standards

## Design Workflow

A typical design workflow with 3Cycle follows these steps:

1. **Analyze requirements** - Understand project constraints and goals
2. **Sketch layouts** - Create schematic designs using module dimensions
3. **Select components** - Choose specific components for each position
4. **Refine details** - Optimize connections and service integration
5. **Plan assembly** - Create detailed assembly sequences
6. **Prepare documentation** - Generate manufacturing and assembly drawings

## Performance Integration

Ensure your design achieves required performance levels:

### Structural Performance

- Verify load paths through the structure
- Check connection capacity under design loads
- Ensure foundation compatibility

### Thermal Performance

- Calculate total thermal resistance of walls and roofs
- Check for thermal bridges at connections
- Verify compliance with energy codes

### Durability

- Ensure adequate protection from weather exposure
- Plan maintenance access for critical components
- Select materials appropriate for local climate

Following these design guidelines ensures your 3Cycle projects achieve the system's full benefits of efficiency, sustainability, and quality.
