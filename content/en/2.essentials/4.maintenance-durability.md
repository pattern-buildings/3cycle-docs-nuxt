3Cycle structures are designed for decades of reliable performance. Proper maintenance ensures your building continues to perform optimally throughout its lifetime.

## Design for Durability

### Material Selection

Durability begins with material selection:

- **Timber species** - Select durable species appropriate for your climate
- **Treatment standards** - Protective treatments prevent decay and insect damage
- **Hardware quality** - Corrosion-resistant fasteners and connections last longer
- **Sealants** - High-quality sealants resist weathering and maintain flexibility

### Environmental Protection

Proper design protects components from damage:

- **Roof overhangs** - Adequate overhangs protect walls from rain
- **Drainage planning** - Design slopes and channels to shed water
- **Vapor management** - Balance vapor transmission to prevent moisture accumulation
- **Access for maintenance** - Design ensures critical components remain accessible

### Connection Design

Well-designed connections last longer:

- **Mechanical connections** - Reduce stress concentrations through proper design
- **Load distribution** - Connections spread loads to avoid overstress
- **Movement accommodation** - Allow for seasonal wood movement and settlement
- **Inspection access** - Design connections accessible for periodic inspection

## Maintenance Program

### Routine Inspection

Regular inspections catch problems early:

**Annual inspection checklist:**

- **Exterior surfaces** - Look for cracks, gaps, or deterioration
- **Cladding condition** - Check for loose boards or damaged sections
- **Roof condition** - Inspect for missing or damaged elements
- **Sealants** - Check for degradation or separation at joints
- **Drainage systems** - Verify gutters, downspouts, and site drainage work properly
- **Access points** - Inspect around utility penetrations for water intrusion

**Seasonal inspections:**

- **Spring** - After winter weather, check for damage and address issues
- **Fall** - Before winter, ensure building is weather-tight and systems functional
- **After storms** - Inspect for weather-related damage

### Maintenance Tasks

#### Exterior Maintenance

Regular care keeps exterior surfaces protected:

**Cladding care:**
- Clean cladding annually to remove dirt and algae
