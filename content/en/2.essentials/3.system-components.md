# 3Cycle Components

The 3Cycle system is built from standardized components that work together to create flexible, efficient building structures. Each component is designed for precision manufacturing, easy assembly, and long-term durability.

## Component Categories

### Structural Components

The foundation of every 3Cycle structure:

- **Modules** - Primary structural units that define space and carry loads
- **Connections** - Standardized joining systems between components
- **Foundation interfaces** - Ground connection and support systems

These components form the primary load-bearing system and define the overall building geometry.

### Enclosure Components

Elements that define the building envelope:

- **Skin systems** - External cladding and weatherproofing layers
- **Insulation modules** - Thermal performance and energy efficiency components
- **Window and door units** - Integrated opening systems with standardized connections

Enclosure components protect the structure and maintain thermal performance while allowing for customization of appearance and functionality.

### Service Components

Infrastructure and utility integration:

- **Service channels** - Integrated pathways for electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems
- **Connection points** - Standardized interfaces for building systems
- **Access panels** - Maintenance and service access points

Service components enable efficient integration of building systems without compromising structural integrity.

## Design Principles

### Standardization

All components follow consistent design rules:

- **Dimensional coordination** - Standard sizing grid across all parts
- **Connection compatibility** - Universal joining methods work throughout the system
- **Material specifications** - Consistent timber grades and treatments
- **Manufacturing tolerances** - Precise dimensional requirements ensure perfect fit

### Modularity

Components are designed for flexible combination:

- **Interchangeable parts** - Components can be used in multiple applications
- **Scalable systems** - Structures can grow or shrink as needed
- **Reconfigurable assemblies** - Components can be rearranged or relocated
- **Upgrade compatibility** - Individual components can be replaced or improved

### Performance

Each component meets specific performance criteria:

- **Structural integrity** - Load-bearing capacity and safety factors
- **Environmental resistance** - Weather and moisture protection
- **Thermal performance** - Insulation and thermal bridging control
- **Durability standards** - Long-term performance expectations

## Component Documentation

Each component includes comprehensive documentation:

- **Technical specifications** - Detailed performance and dimensional data
- **Manufacturing drawings** - Precise fabrication instructions
- **Assembly procedures** - Step-by-step installation guidance
- **Quality standards** - Inspection and testing requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Manufacturing Standards

- **Material certification** - Verified timber grades and treatments
- **Dimensional accuracy** - Precision manufacturing tolerances
- **Surface quality** - Finish standards and protection requirements
- **Connection integrity** - Hardware and joint specifications

### Testing and Validation

- **Structural testing** - Load capacity and performance verification
- **Environmental testing** - Weather resistance and durability studies
- **Quality control** - Systematic inspection processes
- **Performance monitoring** - Long-term behavior assessment

The component system enables efficient manufacturing, reliable assembly, and consistent performance across all 3Cycle applications.
