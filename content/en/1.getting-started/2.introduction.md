Welcome to **3Cycle**, an open-source modular timber construction system designed for flexibility, sustainability, and precision.

## What is 3Cycle?

And why 3?

`And another edit to see if it works`

3Cycle is a comprehensive system of standardized components that work together to create efficient, modular building structures. Developed in Estonia, it combines decades of construction expertise with modern manufacturing techniques to deliver a scalable, sustainable approach to building.

The system is designed for:

- **Architects** - Complete freedom to design with standardized building blocks
- **Builders** - Efficient assembly with precision-manufactured components
- **Developers** - Open documentation and specifications for implementation

## Core Principles

### Standardization

All components follow consistent design rules and manufacturing standards. This ensures:

- **Dimensional coordination** - Standard sizing grids across all components
- **Connection compatibility** - Universal joining methods throughout the system
- **Predictable performance** - Consistent material specifications and tolerances

### Modularity

Components are designed for flexible combination:

- Mix and match components to suit project requirements
- Reconfigure assemblies as needs change
- Upgrade or replace individual components independently

### Sustainability

Built with environmental responsibility:

- Timber-based construction with sustainable sourcing
- Long-term durability reduces environmental impact
- Open-source documentation minimizes waste through precision

## System Components

3Cycle is built from three main component categories:

1. **Structural Components** - Load-bearing modules and connections
2. **Enclosure Components** - Walls, insulation, and opening systems
3. **Service Components** - Utility integration and access points

Each category works together to create complete, functional buildings from standardized, interchangeable parts.
